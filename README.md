# Back End Database Project
The user has the ability to view all queries or search for a specific query.

If the user selects "view all queries", they are given the option to select multiple different columns from the database. Once the user is sastisfied
with the columns they want to view, all the rows for those columns are displayed.

If the user selects "search for a specific query", they are given the option to select a column to search in. Once the user selects a column, 
they have the ability to type a term to search for in that column. This will retrieve all the rows that contain the specified search term.
The user is given the ability to sort the rows based on a specific column by ascending or descending order. 
They are also given the ability to get the top N results that match their search query inputs.
